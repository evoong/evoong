#### [**Patent Landscape Visualization**](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/canadian-intellectual-property-office/sites/default/files/attachments/2022/CIPOCS-1912-CPLFPMT-eng.pdf#page=29)
- Developed a patent landscape tool using **machine learning** and **NLP techniques** like **TF-IDF**, **Principal Directional Analysis (PDA)**, and **Sentence Transformers** to extract and analyze key trends from patent data. This project improved trend analysis accuracy by 60% and was presented to the Canadian Intellectual Property Office.

#### [**Concert Price Predictor**](https://github.com/evoong/Concert-Price-Predictor)
- Built a concert price prediction tool that scrapes ticket pricing, event details, and artist social media statistics using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. Leveraged scikit-learn to develop a machine learning model with Random Forest Regression to predict concert ticket prices based on gathered data.

#### [**Reliable File Transfer Protocol over UDP**](https://github.com/evoong/Reliable-File-Transfer-Protocol-over-UDP)
- Designed a custom protocol for reliable file transfer over UDP in **Python**. This protocol includes error detection and correction mechanisms, achieving a 70% improvement in transfer reliability, even under high-noise conditions.

#### [**Huffman Coding Algorithm**](https://github.com/evoong/Huffman)
- Implemented a **Huffman algorithm** in **Java** to optimize data storage and transmission. This project achieved a 50% reduction in file size while maintaining data integrity.
